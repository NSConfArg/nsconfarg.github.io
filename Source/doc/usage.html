<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Once you have cloned or downloaded HTML5 Boilerplate, creating a site or app
usually involves the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up the basic structure of the site.</li>
  <li>Add some content, style, and functionality.</li>
  <li>Run your site locally to see how it looks.</li>
  <li>(Optionally run a build script to automate the optimization of your site -
e.g. <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/ant-build-script">ant build script</a> or <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script">node
build script</a>).</li>
  <li>Deploy your site.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Basic structure</h2>

<p>A basic HTML5 Boilerplate site initially looks something like this:</p>

<p><code>
.
├── css
│   ├── main.css
│   └── normalize.css
├── doc
├── img
├── js
│   ├── main.js
│   ├── plugins.js
│   └── vendor
│       ├── jquery.min.js
│       └── modernizr.min.js
├── .htaccess
├── 404.html
├── index.html
├── humans.txt
├── robots.txt
├── crossdomain.xml
├── favicon.ico
└── [apple-touch-icons]
</code></p>

<p>What follows is a general overview of each major part and how to use them.</p>

<h3>css</h3>

<p>This directory should contain all your project’s CSS files. It includes some
initial CSS to help get you started from a solid foundation. <a href="css.md">About the
CSS</a>.</p>

<h3>doc</h3>

<p>This directory contains all the HTML5 Boilerplate documentation. You can use it
as the location and basis for your own project’s documentation.</p>

<h3>js</h3>

<p>This directory should contain all your project’s JS files. Libraries, plugins,
and custom code can all be included here. It includes some initial JS to help
get you started. <a href="js.md">About the JavaScript</a>.</p>

<h3>.htaccess</h3>

<p>The default web server config is for Apache. <a href="htaccess.md">About the .htaccess</a>.</p>

<p>Host your site on a server other than Apache? You’re likely to find the
corresponding configuration file in our <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs">server configs
repo</a>. If you cannot find a
configuration file for your setup, please consider contributing one so that
others can benefit too.</p>

<h3>404.html</h3>

<p>A helpful custom 404 to get you started.</p>

<h3>index.html</h3>

<p>This is the default HTML skeleton that should form the basis of all pages on
your site. If you are using a server-side templating framework, then you will
need to integrate this starting HTML with your setup.</p>

<p>Make sure that you update the URLs for the referenced CSS and JavaScript if you
modify the directory structure at all.</p>

<p>If you are using Google Analytics, make sure that you edit the corresponding
snippet at the bottom to include your analytics ID.</p>

<h3>humans.txt</h3>

<p>Edit this file to include the team that worked on your site/app, and the
technology powering it.</p>

<h3>robots.txt</h3>

<p>Edit this file to include any pages you need hidden from search engines.</p>

<h3>crossdomain.xml</h3>

<p>A template for working with cross-domain requests. <a href="crossdomain.md">About
crossdomain.xml</a>.</p>

<h3>icons</h3>

<p>Replace the default <code>favicon.ico</code> and apple touch icons with your own. You
